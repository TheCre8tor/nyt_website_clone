                            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

                            <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
                            have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe 
                            bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
                            infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the 
                            universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

                            <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform 
                            from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron 
                            out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be 
                            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                            
                            <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                            the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
                            looked right.</p>

                            <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes 
                            at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
                            for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — 
                            the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
                            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
                            inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                            <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. 
                            Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>

                            <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the 
                            recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. 
                            It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>

                            <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years 
                            in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger 
                            cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe 
                            there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot 
                            of pasta water boiling over.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>&lsquo;As Big as It Gets&rsquo;</strong></p>

                            <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                            forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity 
                            itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, 
                            which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>

                            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part 
                            of the team, said, <q>This is huge, as big as it gets.</q></p>

                            <p>He continued, <q>This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
                            in gravitational waves.</q></p>
                            
                            <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation 
                            that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and 
                            as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background 
                            Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing 
                            at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The 
                            Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                                    <span>FLUCTUATION</span>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls 
                                    of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. 
                                    These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

                            <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself <q>bowled over,</q> saying he had not expected such 
                            a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>

                            <p><q>With nature, you have to be lucky,</q> he said. <q>Apparently we have been lucky.</q></p>
                            
                            <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years&rsquo; worth of observations 
                            and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of 
                            his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
                            Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in 
                            his office last week.</p>

                            <p><q>It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,</q> said Dr. 
                            Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>

                            <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant 
                            of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean 
                            last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on 
                            his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.</p>

                            <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

                            <p><q>And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did 
                            not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years 
                            ago,</q> Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>

                            <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. 
                            <q>Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,</q> he said.</p>
                            
                            <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news 
                            spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

                            <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, <q>I think that if this stays true, 
                            it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.</q></p>

                            <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing 
                            project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. <q>I think the 
                            results are beautiful and very convincing,</q> he said.</p>

                            <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting 
                            that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background 
                            by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>

                            <p><q>So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,</q> Dr. Krauss said.</p>

                            <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings 
                            this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops 
                            and space.</p>

                            <p><strong>&lsquo;Spirals in the Sky&rsquo;</strong></p>

                            <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were 
                            discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel 
                            Prize.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders 
                            of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, 
                            where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the 
                            University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

                            <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He 
                            has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                            <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, 
                            meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>

                            <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. 
                            Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist 
                            the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization 
                            in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>

                            <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of 
                            the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
                            
                            <p><q>We had no expectations what we would see,</q> Dr. Kovac said.</p>

                            <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a 
                            Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them 
                            to the breakthrough.</q></p>

                            <p><strong>&lsquo;A Special Time&rsquo;</strong></p>

                            <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in 
                            his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>

                            <p><q>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong 
                            and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a 
                            single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>

                            <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk 
                            mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force 
                            after another splitting away.</p>

                            <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>

                            <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, 
                            until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>

                            <p>Similarly, the universe could <q>supercool</q> and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space 
                            itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>

                            <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the 
                            universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was 
                            created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>

                            <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a 
                            submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>

                            <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of 
                            normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars 
                            billions of light-years across. <q>It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,</q> Dr. Guth 
                            likes to say, <q>but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.</q></p>\

                            <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest 
                            that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey 
                            expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept 
                            known as the multiverse.</p>

                            <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper 
                            into the past.</p>

                            <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases 
                            everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever 
                            out of our view.</p>

                            <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of 
                            the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
